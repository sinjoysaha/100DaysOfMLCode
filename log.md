# 100 Days Of ML Code - LOG

## Day 0 : August 30 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Setting up the things I require for this challenge. Revised Python by working on the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com) problems. New things learnt - working with URLs and zip files in Python.

**Thoughts** : Since I've already completed the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera, this challenge will mostly be about implementing stuff.
Hope it will be an interesting journey. Will be tracking my progress here and on Twitter.

## Day 1 : August 31 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Wrapping my head around git in the Command Line. Also, continuing the Python refresher. Pushed a few changes to my repo.

**Thoughts** : Once you get used to it, git in Command Line is really cool!! Also, that python challenge is really well made!! Learning a lot of new and exciting stuff.

## Day 2 : September 1 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Started with Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. (Level 1 already completed!) Also, playing around with Sublime Text 3. 

**Thoughts** : Kaggle Learn seems a good place to start implementing and taking part in competitions, especially since I've already completed the ML course by Prof. Ng on Coursera. Also, Sublime Text is so cool!!

## Day 3 : September 2 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learnt One Hot Encoding and handling categorical/ non-numeric data - Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. Also, watched a few git tutorials. 

**Thoughts** : Learning a lot of new things, not all directly linked to ML but is beneficial to know.

## Day 4 : September 3 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Implemented everything learnt so far in the Kaggle Housing Prices Prediction.

**Thoughts** : Implementing things and getting hands dirty with data is so much more fun than just learning the theory.

## Day 5 : September 4 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning XGBoost from Kaggle (link below).

**Thoughts** : Need to spend more time on this topic.

**Link of Work:**   [XGBoost - Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/xgboost) 

## Day 6 : September 5 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Implemented XGBRegressor in the Housing Prices Competitions on Kaggle.

**Thoughts** : Wasted a lot of time today on installing xgboost. Finally conda install came to the rescue. But, it was so worth it. Improving scores on Kaggle. However, more fine tuning required.

## Day 7 : September 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning Partial Dependence Plots on Kaggle Learn (link below).

**Thoughts** : Great for visualisation and insights on how each feature contributes to the target/ label.

## Day 8 : September 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning about Pipelines and producing cleaner code on Kaggle Learn (link below).

**Thoughts** : Realizing the importance of pipelines for production quality, clean and deployable code. Waiting for the Advanced Pipelines tutorial. Also, facing some difficulties with partial dependence plots from yesterday. Will look into that tomorrow.

## Day 9 : September 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning about Cross-Validation on Kaggle Learn (link below).

**Thoughts** : Slowing down a bit (but not stopping) as we have our mid-semester tests from next week.
