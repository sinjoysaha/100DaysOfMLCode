# 100 Days Of ML Code - LOG

## Day 0 : August 30 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Setting up the things I require for this challenge. Revised Python by working on the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com) problems. New things learnt - working with URLs and zip files in Python.

**Thoughts** : Since I've already completed the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera, this challenge will mostly be about implementing stuff.
Hope it will be an interesting journey. Will be tracking my progress here and on Twitter.

## Day 1 : August 31 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Wrapping my head around git in the Command Line. Also, continuing the Python refresher. Pushed a few changes to my repo.

**Thoughts** : Once you get used to it, git in Command Line is really cool!! Also, that python challenge is really well made!! Learning a lot of new and exciting stuff.

## Day 2 : September 1 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Started with Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. (Level 1 already completed!) Also, playing around with Sublime Text 3. 

**Thoughts** : Kaggle Learn seems a good place to start implementing and taking part in competitions, especially since I've already completed the ML course by Prof. Ng on Coursera. Also, Sublime Text is so cool!!

## Day 3 : September 2 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learnt One Hot Encoding and handling categorical/ non-numeric data - Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. Also, watched a few git tutorials. 

**Thoughts** : Learning a lot of new things, not all directly linked to ML but is beneficial to know.
