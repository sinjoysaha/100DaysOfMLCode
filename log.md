# 100 Days Of ML Code - LOG

## Day 0 : August 30 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Setting up the things I require for this challenge. Revised Python by working on the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com) problems. New things learnt - working with URLs and zip files in Python.

**Thoughts** : Since I've already completed the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera, this challenge will mostly be about implementing stuff.
Hope it will be an interesting journey. Will be tracking my progress here and on Twitter.

## Day 1 : August 31 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Wrapping my head around git in the Command Line. Also, continuing the Python refresher. Pushed a few changes to my repo.

**Thoughts** : Once you get used to it, git in Command Line is really cool!! Also, that python challenge is really well made!! Learning a lot of new and exciting stuff.

## Day 2 : September 1 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Started with Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. (Level 1 already completed!) Also, playing around with Sublime Text 3. 

**Thoughts** : Kaggle Learn seems a good place to start implementing and taking part in competitions, especially since I've already completed the ML course by Prof. Ng on Coursera. Also, Sublime Text is so cool!!

## Day 3 : September 2 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learnt One Hot Encoding and handling categorical/ non-numeric data - Machine Learning Level 2 on Kaggle Learn. Also, watched a few git tutorials. 

**Thoughts** : Learning a lot of new things, not all directly linked to ML but is beneficial to know.

## Day 4 : September 3 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Implemented everything learnt so far in the Kaggle Housing Prices Prediction.

**Thoughts** : Implementing things and getting hands dirty with data is so much more fun than just learning the theory.

## Day 5 : September 4 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning XGBoost from Kaggle (link below).

**Thoughts** : Need to spend more time on this topic.

**Link of Work:**   [XGBoost - Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/xgboost) 

## Day 6 : September 5 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Implemented XGBRegressor in the Housing Prices Competitions on Kaggle.

**Thoughts** : Wasted a lot of time today on installing xgboost. Finally conda install came to the rescue. But, it was so worth it. Improving scores on Kaggle. However, more fine tuning required.

## Day 10 : September 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Learning about Data Leakage on Kaggle Learn (link below). ML Level-2 on Kaggle Learn done!

**Thoughts** : Data Leakage is a pretty serious issue. Also, nice to know that Kaggle has rare data leakage issues in their carefully curated datasets, but can't ignore it real-world problems.
